# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

	This project illustrates how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
	The purpose is to show Louise some comparables to her play *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	To analyze the outcomes based on launch date, I prepared a line chart. This visual illustrates the count of campaigns by month and outcome.  
	Each line represent a  different outcome. The results only show campaigns within
	the Theatre parent category.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	To analyze the outcomes based on goals, I prepared a line chart. The line chart shows the percentage of successful, failed,   
	and canceled campaigns for goals at every
	5,000 increment. The results only show campaigns within the Plays subcategory.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	One of the challenge encountered during the analysis was to ensure the amount of campaigns in both visual were representative of the   
	amount of campaigns in the main database, based on the filters applied.  
	To overcome the challenge, I applied manual filters on the main database to cross reference the amount of campaigns, and to ensure data integrity.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	As illustrated in the Outcomes vs Launch visual, the best months for a successful campaign are Apr, May, Jun, and Jul. Not only do those months have the most successful campaigns, they also have the 
	largest gap when compared to failed campaigns. The peak month for most successful launches is May. The slowest month of the year is Dec, where there are nearly as many failed campaigns as successful ones.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	
	There seem to be a clear message about campaigns with goals above 45,000. Very little are successful, and many of them fail. One could conclude that in order to have a successful campaign, use a goal under 45,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

	The visuals could be easily misleading due to the low number of campaigns for by goal increment. For example, the line chart shows a 100% failed rate and 0% successful rate for campaigns in the 45,000 to 49,999 increment.
	There was only one campaign in that increment, which failed. The visual does not show the amount of campaigns, which could mislead the end consumer.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	An interesting table for Louise would be to look at US campaigns in 2016 with a goal of under 5,000. This could help us find trends for the year that her campaigned was launched, with a goal similar to hers.
	An interesting graph to show, using the aforementioned table, would be a line chart that illustrates how many campaigns we're successful or failed over the months, specifically for 2016 and US.
