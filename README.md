	The purpose is to show Louise some comparables to her play *Fever*.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	As illustrated in the Outcomes vs Launch visual, the best months for a successful campaign are Apr, May, Jun, and Jul. Not only do those months have the most successful campaigns, they also have the 
	largest gap when compared to failed campaigns. The peak month for most successful launches is May. The slowest month of the year is Dec, where there are nearly as many failed campaigns as successful ones.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
